<p>My PhD thesis is entitled &ldquo;Algebraic Soft Decoding of Reed-Solomon Codes Based on Module and Dual Codewords (基于模和对偶码字的Reed-Solomon码代数软译码)&rdquo;, which focuses on low-complexity soft decoding of Reed-Solomon (RS) codes using module basis reduction (BR) technique and minimum-weight dual codewords. Based on the BR interpolation, the thesis utilizes re-encoding transform, progressive decoding and Chase decoding to propose several low-complexity and high-performance RS decoding algorithms, hoping to facilitate the industrial applications of the algebraic soft decoding. The thesis also introduces a novel shift-sum decoding scheme for the iterative decoding, which was grown during my visit of Prof. Bossert in 2019. This concept may bring some research topics on the soft decoding of RS codes. This thesis was selected as the Outstanding Doctoral Dissertation Award by Chinese Institute of Electronics Information Theory Society.</p>
<h2>Abstract </h2>
<p>Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are widely applied in data transmission and storage systems due to its capability of correcting burst errors. Currently, the efficient Berlekamp-Massey (BM) algorithm is utilized in practice, but its error-correction capability is limited by half of the code's minimum Hamming distance. The interpolation based algebraic decoding can correct errors beyond this bound. Utilizing soft information, algebraic soft decoding (ASD) further improves the decoding performance. However, their decoding complexity remain high, limiting the practical applications. This thesis will focus on low-complexity soft decoding using basis reduction (BR) and dual codewords, hoping to facilitate its applications.</p>
<p>The thesis begins to work on the ASD using BR technique, namely the ASD-BR algorithm. It first generates a module which contains bivariate polynomials that interpolate all the prescribed points with their multiplicity. Presenting the module basis as a matrix over univariate polynomials, row operation further reduces it into a Gröbner basis, where the minimum candidate is the interpolation polynomial <img class="eq" src="eqs/7724951168567577445-130.png" alt="Q(x,y)" style="vertical-align: -5px" />. The thesis then proposes the re-encoding transformed ASD-BR (ReT-ASD-BR) algorithm. By performing coordinate transform for the interpolation points, a common divisor can be removed from the polynomials of module basis, lowering the ASD-BR complexity. Based on assessing the degree of module seeds, a complexity reducing approach is introduced to further facilitate these two algorithms. Complexity analysis characterizes the complexity reduction brought by the ReT. It also shows that the ASD-BR and the ReT-ASD-BR algorithms yield a lower decoding complexity for high rate codes, which is preferred in practice. Simulation results demonstrate that the BR interpolation yields a remarkably lower complexity for the ASD than the conventional Kötter's interpolation.</p>
<p>In order to make the ASD-BR algorithm more flexible, this thesis proposes the progressive ASD-BR (PASD-BR) algorithm. It constructs the interpolation polynomial <img class="eq" src="eqs/7724951168567577445-130.png" alt="Q(x,y)" style="vertical-align: -5px" /> with a progressively enlarged <img class="eq" src="eqs/15488046584-130.png" alt="y" style="vertical-align: -4px" />-degree and terminates once the maximum likelihood codeword is decoded, adjusting its error-correction capability and decoding complexity to the received information. Polynomial <img class="eq" src="eqs/7724951168567577445-130.png" alt="Q(x,y)" style="vertical-align: -5px" /> can be constructed through the image of the progressively enlarged submodule basis without the need of memorizing the intermediate decoding information, eliminating the memory cost of the Kötter's interpolation based PASD algorithm. The BR interpolation also attributes to a lower complexity than the PASD algorithm. The re-encoding transformed PASD-BR (ReT-PASD-BR) algorithm is proposed to further reduce the decoding complexity. Complexity analysis also shows that high rate codes benefit a greater complexity reduction. Moreover, the tradeoff between the ReT computation and the complexity reduction it brings is also analyzed. Simulation results show these two algorithms maintain the ASD-BR decoding performance. Their complexity decrease as the signal-to-noise ratio increases and converge to the minimum level, revealing their channel dependent feature.</p>
<p>The thesis continues to introduce the BR based low-complexity Chase (LCC-BR) decoding algorithm. Based on the reliability matrix, it identifies several unreliable symbols to formulate a number of decoding test-vectors. Utilizing the similarity among these test-vectors, the LCC-BR algorithm ﬁrst constructs a common basis which will be reduced and shared by the parallel decoding of all test-vectors. This eliminates the redundant computation in decoding each test-vector, resulting in a lower decoding complexity and latency. To make the decoding more flexible, this paper further proposes the progressive LCC-BR (PLCC-BR) algorithm that decodes the test-vectors sequentially and terminates once the maximum-likelihood codeword is reached, resulting in a channel dependent characterization. Exploiting the difference between the adjacent test-vectors, the PLCC-BR algorithm is realized without any additional memory cost. Complexity analysis shows that the LCC-BR algorithm exhibits a low decoding complexity and latency. For high rate codes, simulation results show that under the similar decoding performance, the LCC-BR and the PLCC-BR algorithms yield a lower decoding complexity than the ReT-ASD-BR and the ReT-PASD-BR algorithms, respectively.</p>
<p>Finally, this thesis works on a novel shift-sum (SS) decoding scheme for RS codes. A number of cyclically different minimum-weight dual codewords are first constructed. With these codewords and their cyclic shifts, a reliability measure can be yielded as an indicator for the error positions and the error magnitudes. Based on this measure, an iterative SS (ISS) decoding is proposed, which can correct errors beyond the half distance bound, yielding the same performance as the Guruswami-Sudan decoding. By utilizing soft information, a soft-decision ISS (SISS) decoding is further introduced to improve the decoding performance. These two SS based iterative decoding are realized with polynomial multiplication and integer (or real number) comparison, which are hardware-friendly. An improved SISS algorithm is further proposed to enhance the soft decoding performance. Utilizing the test-vectors formulated by Chase mechanism, the ISS and the SISS algorithms can be performed for each of them, yielding a better performance improvement. Simulation results demonstrate the performance potential and low-complexity feature of the proposed algorithms</p>
